# Theory Of Octal-Relative Propagation
### Theory Of Light Propagation As Octal Diffusion

In a Densiotropic Universe light propagates as a densiotropic quantity with 8 diffusional rates that form a octal diffusion ratio.

For each cell of a Diffusional universe light has 9 numeric quantities:
* 8 diffusion rates (one for each adjacent cell.)
* Total density of light
